# Overview

See DLFA-200: [v1 indexer: compare acceptance test Solr response samples against prod](https://jira.nyu.edu/browse/DLFA-200).

# Scripts

* _diff-report.html_: generates an HTML file with links to resources to help
                      analyze diff reports in _diffs/_.  There are currently no
                      significant diffs.
* _diff-samples.sh_: generates diff files in _diffs/_
* _fetch-samples.sh_: fetches responses from acceptance test and prod Solr instances

# Output directories

* _diffs/_: diff reports generated by _diff-samples.sh_.  There are currently no
  significant diffs.
* _local/_: responses from acceptance test Solr
  * EAD files version: https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads_v2/tree/b666767ce36d7cb2e2941fc73f53fbfbfe7b1ce6
* _prod/_: responses from prod Solr
  * EAD files version: https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads_v2/commit/af58bdcecdfd5376e53f1e7b78f4dda81358fae6

# List files

* _exclude-list.txt_: contains EAD IDs to be excluded from diff'ing because they
                      were modified in prod after the full indexing to local was
                      completed
* _list.txt_: list of EAD IDs to fetch samples for from the local and prod Solr
              instances

# Results
