        "abstract_ssm":["William C. Kingsley (1833-1885) was a distinguished businessman, politican, and engineer who is most well-known for his prominent role in the building of the Brooklyn Bridge.  Kingsley's connection with the Brooklyn Bridge began in 1866, when he played an instrumental role in generating interest among wealthy members of the private sector in the prospect of a bridge connecting the two cities of Brooklyn and New York.  Over the course of the building of the bridge, Kinglsey served as a member of the Board of Trustees, Vice President, and President of the New York Bridge Company, overseeing the completion and opening of the bridge in 1883.  Aside from his work as an engineer and contractor, Kingsley was also actively involved in much of the political and business life of Brooklyn.  The William C. Kingsley familiy collection spans the period circa 1870 to 1950 and pertains to William C. Kingsley and his family, as well as the Brooklyn Bridge.  Materials include a scrapbook of newspaper clippings on the Kingsley family's business and social affairs; memorial items published in tribute to William C. Kingsley and his son, Harry Smith Kingsley; publications celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Brooklyn Bridge; correspondence; and a mounted print of the Brooklyn Bridge taken from the Brooklyn side of the East River, among other items."],
