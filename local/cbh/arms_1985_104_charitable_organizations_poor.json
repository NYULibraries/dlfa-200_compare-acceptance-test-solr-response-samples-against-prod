In response to the growing welfare burden, a number of charitable organizations were established to provide relief for the poor.  Charity organization became more proficient and specialized throughout the 19th century as New York's poverty rate continued to rise.  The Brooklyn charitable organizations for the poor collection spans the period 1809 to 1959 and contains publications and ephemera documenting the activities of a significant number of Brooklyn-based public welfare organizations.  Items include annual reports, manuals, constitutions, bylaws, articles of incorporation, handbooks, directories, newsletters, journals, historical sketches, pamphlets, and programs."],
