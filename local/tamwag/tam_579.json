        "abstract_ssm":["Marilyn Albert was a Communist Party USA (CPUSA) activist in New York City during the 1970s-1980s, and was part of the \"Initiative\" group, a network of reformist Party members, active ca. 1989-1991, most of whom left the Party after their political defeat at the Party's 25th national convention in early 1991, and went on, with a large minority of Party members, to form the Committees of Correspondence (now the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism). A registered nurse, Albert also was, from 1974-2003, a member, shop steward, and staff organizer in Local 1199, which represents hospital and health care workers in New York City. This bulk of this unprocessed collection relates to the internal struggle within the CPUSA. The bulk of this material was generated by the \"Initiative\" group or those associated with it, natonally, and in the New York and California Party organizations. There is also a file of documents generated by the CPUSA leadership. There is also a folder of a few materials from the 1970s concerning the Party's positions and program on women's equality, and a file of materials (\"Defense Lawyers Committee\") related to the Smith Act trials in California in the late 1940s-early 1950s."],
